Crypto Live Tracker:
The Crypto Live Tracker is a web-based application that provides real-time cryptocurrency price updates using the Binance API. 
It enables users to enter a cryptocurrency symbol (e.g., BTC, ETH) and fetch key market data such as current price, 24-hour price change, highest and lowest prices, and trading volume.
The application also displays the top 5 most cryptocurrency with most price change in 24hs based on trading volume. 
Designed with a dark-themed finance-oriented UI, it ensures an intuitive user experience. 
The system fetches data asynchronously using JavaScript (fetch API) to ensure seamless real-time updates. 
This project aims to help investors and crypto enthusiasts make informed decisions by providing accurate and up-to-date market insights.
